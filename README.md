Physical feature engineering and machine learning for polymer thermal conductivity prediction
## Description
An interpretable machine learning framework for exploring high thermal conductivity polymer structures and extracted the chemical heuristic for high thermal conductivity polymers design through underlying mechanism analysis. The physical features engineering approach is applicable not only to organic thermal functional materials, but also for the discovery of high-performance polymers with other desired properties.
